# Limit of Infinity
A game for Ludum Dare 54

The Abyssal Realms have been sundered into countless spheres. It is your job to rebuild the connections between them, until enough of the Abyssal Threads have been built to draw the spheres together and reconstitute the Realms!

* Use WASD to move
* Space bar to shoot
* Press Shift while on a thread gate to go to a different map (Warning: old maps keep going while youâ€™re gone!)
* Build things using the menu on the left
* Angler fish destroy your buildings, kill them with shooting, seekers, or jellyfish
* Build abyssal threads on six different maps to win!

Good luck!
